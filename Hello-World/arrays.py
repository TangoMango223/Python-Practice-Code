#Arrays in Python

# In Python, LISTS = ARRAYS. They are dynamic, so no memory issues
# Tuples = like lists but they cannot change or cannot be amended.
# Lists = can be changed as often as you'd like


#Make a blank array
scores = [] #lists

scores.append(72) #assignment #1
scores.append(85) #assignment #2 score
scores.append(97) #assignment #3 scores
